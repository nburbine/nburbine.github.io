    <h3><b>Work Experience</b></h3>
    <p>During my time as a student I have had the opportunity to complete two temporary work experiences, each lasting
        6-months.</p>
    <p>My first was with the DevOps team at Dell EMC in Hopkinton, MA. I was assigned to create a monitoring solution
        for test servers which exposed me to Docker and Nagios. I was able to rely on senior developers to verify my
        design choices which taught me how to think like a software developer. I also got a taste of customer support
        as I audited the support ticket backlog of DevOps team and followed up on open issues.</p>
    <p>My next was with the IT department of the Monroe County School District where I was responsible for day-to-day
        tech support of an elementary school of 550+ students and 50+ teachers/administrators. There, I was able to
        refine my customer support skills through assisting users with varied technical and personal backgrounds.
        I became adept at troubleshooting issues with Windows devices, printers, Chromebooks, and iPads.</p>
